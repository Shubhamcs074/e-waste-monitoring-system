# ♻️ E-Waste Management System

A web-based software system designed to promote responsible electronic waste management.

---

## ✅ Goal

The system aims to:

- Track electronic devices
- Identify when devices become obsolete
- Let users raise e-waste collection requests
- Connect requests with certified recyclers
- Display e-waste statistics to administrators
- Promote responsible consumption

## 🧩 Step-by-Step Guide

### 🏗️ 1: Plan System Architecture

#### ✅ Identify 3 User Roles

| Role       | Capabilities                                                   |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| User/Org   | Register devices, raise pickup requests                        |
| Recycler   | View assigned requests, mark as picked/recycled               |
| Admin      | Add recyclers, assign them to requests, view statistics       |

---

### 🗃️ 2: Design the Database

Use **PostgreSQL** or **MongoDB** as your database.

#### 🧾 Key Tables / Collections

- **Users**:  
  `id`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `role`

- **Devices**:  
  `id`, `user_id`, `name`, `purchase_date`, `status`, `location`

- **Recyclers**:  
  `id`, `name`, `service_radius_km`, `location`, `license_id`

- **CollectionRequests**:  
  `id`, `device_id`, `user_id`, `recycler_id`, `status`, `request_date`, `pickup_date`

---

### 💻 3: Backend (Flask / Django)

#### 🔧 Features

Create RESTful APIs for:

- User authentication (register/login)
- Add / view devices
- Create / view collection requests
- Assign recycler (auto or admin-based)
- View dashboard statistics

---

### 🎨 4: Frontend (React.js)

#### 🖥️ Pages

- **User Dashboard**: Track registered devices, request pickup
- **Recycler Dashboard**: View assigned collection requests
- **Admin Dashboard**: View statistics, manage users/recyclers

---

### 📍 5: Matching Recycler (Smart Assignment)

Use the **Google Maps API** or a simple **Haversine formula** in Python to locate the nearest recycler:

---

### 📊 6: Dashboard Analytics

Use **Chart.js** or Recharts to show:

- Total devices
- E-waste generated
- Requests completed/pending

---

### 📬 7: Notifications
- Use email (SendGrid or SMTP) to notify recycler on assignment

- Show frontend alerts/notifications to users and admins

---
### 🚀 8: Deploy the Project
- Frontend: Vercel or Netlify

- Backend: Render or Railway

- Database: PostgreSQL on ElephantSQL or MongoDB Atlas
